# Wine-Quality-Prediction
Itâ€™s a known fact that older the wine, better the taste. However, there are several factors other than age that go into wine quality certification which include physiochemical tests like alcohol quantity, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, determination of density, pH and more. The main goal of this machine learning project is to build a machine learning model to predict the quality of wines by exploring their various chemical properties. Wine quality dataset consists of 4898 observations with 11 independent and 1 dependent variable.
